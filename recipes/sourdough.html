    <p>Biting into a piece of homemade sourdough is reminiscent of being at home in front of a fire on a cold winter's night. The combination of a crunchy crust and a fluffy, sour centre, make for a delicious and versatile loaf of bread that anyone can enjoy. Sourdough is a bread made by the fermentation of dough using wild lactobacillaceae and yeast. Lactic acid from fermentation imparts a sour taste and improves keeping qualities.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100 g sourdough starter</li>
            <li>350 g lukewarm water</li>
            <li>400 g plain flour</li>
            <li>100 g wholemeal flour</li>
            <li>10 g salt</li>
            <li>Rice flour, to dust</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Cooking instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the starter and water in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in the combined flour and use your hands to mix until a sticky dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 mins to rest.</li>
            <li>Add salt and use your hands to work the mixture well until the salt dissolves. Cover and set aside for 30 mins to rest.</li>
            <li>Use wet hands to lift and pull one side of the dough up in the bowl, then fold it over the remaining dough. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat. Repeat the folding and rotating process 8 more times. Cover the dough and set aside for 1 hour to rest.</li>
            <li>Repeat folding, rotating and resting process 3 more times. The dough should become more elastic with each fold.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Starting at the end closest to you, slide a pastry scraper or your hand just under the dough. Lift slightly and turn dough 180 degrees anticlockwise, then drag it towards you. Keep lifting, turning and dragging the dough until it forms a tight ball.</li>
            <li>Line a medium glass bowl with a clean tea towel and dust generously with rice flour. Place the dough top-side down in the bowl. Cover with a tea towel and place the bowl in a large plastic bag. Place in fridge overnight or until dough is one and a half times its original size.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 250 degrees Celsius. Place a large heavy casserole pan with a lid in the oven for 30 mins to preheat. Place a large sheet of baking paper on top of the dough and gently rest your hand over the paper. Quickly turn the dough and paper onto a clean work surface. Use a small, very sharp knife to carefully make 4-7 slashes, without cutting too deep, in the top of the dough. Carefully place dough on baking paper in the hot casserole pan. Cover with lid. Bake for 25 mins. Remove lid. Bake, uncovered, for 20 mins or until the loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
            <li>Transfer the bread to a wire rack. Set aside for 30 mins to cool.</li>
        </ol>
